=====================

Share Coordination
------------------

This feature makes it easier to share specific coordinate information during layout design,  
helping engineers collaborate more effectively.  
Sharing coordinates accurately can be tricky, especially when working across different screens.  
This tool solves that problem by providing a simple and precise way to capture, display, and share layout coordinates.

**Features:**

- **Coordinate Capture**  

  Simply press the **Get Coordination** button and right-click on the layout to grab coordinate values.  

- **Viewport Synchronization**  

  It uses the window's bounding box (BBox) to replicate the exact layout view on another screen,  
  ensuring everyone is on the same page.  

- **Interactive Highlighting**  

  Clicking a coordinate entry highlights the matching location in the layout with a diamond-shaped marker,  
  making it easier to follow along.  

- **Data Persistence**  

  The built-in **Save/Load** function lets you export and import coordinate data through files,  
  so you can save and reuse shared views whenever you need.
