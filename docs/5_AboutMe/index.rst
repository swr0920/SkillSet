During the IC layout process, I observed that certain repetitive tasks—such as port bus numbering and connecting bus lines—were consuming a considerable amount of time, despite being relatively straightforward.

I recognized that by identifying consistent patterns within these tasks, it would be possible to automate or significantly streamline the workflow. This realization led to the development of SkillSet.
